## Notes

- All queries should work with the "Show Chart" checkbox enabled
- Charts will automatically be generated based on the query type and data structure
- The chatbot supports various chart types including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts
- Queries can be asked in natural language - the examples above are just suggestions
- The chatbot will intelligently detect when a chart would be helpful and generate it accordingly

---

## Example Usage

1. Enable the "Show Chart" checkbox in the chat interface
2. Ask any of the questions above
3. The chatbot will respond with both a text answer and a visual chart
4. Charts are interactive and can be zoomed, panned, and explored

## Tips for Best Results

- Be specific about what dimension you want to analyze (model, part, age, mileage, etc.)
- Use terms like "by", "grouped by", "breakdown", "distribution", "compare" to trigger chart generation
- Questions about rates, percentages, and comparisons typically generate charts
- Multi-dimensional queries (e.g., "by model and age") create more complex visualizations
